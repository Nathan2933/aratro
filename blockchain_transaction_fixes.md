# Blockchain Transaction Fixes

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to fix issues with blockchain transactions not being found for recent requests.

## Problem

The main issues identified were:

1. **Fake Transaction Hashes**: The code was generating fake transaction hashes when it couldn't get the real transaction hash from the blockchain.
2. **Blockchain Connection Issues**: The code wasn't properly handling connection failures.
3. **Error Handling Problems**: When blockchain operations failed, the code caught the exceptions but then continued to create database records with fake transaction hashes.
4. **Transaction Receipt Retrieval Issues**: The code was using an unreliable method to get transaction receipts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `blockchain.py`

- Updated `create_stock_request` method to return both the blockchain ID and transaction hash
- Updated `update_stock_request_status` method to return both success status and transaction hash
- Improved error handling in blockchain operations

### 2. Modified `blockchain_integration.py`

- Removed code that generates fake transaction hashes
- Now storing the actual transaction hash returned by `send_raw_transaction`
- Marking transactions as 'pending' initially, then updating to 'confirmed' after confirmation
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. Modified `blockchain_routes.py`

- Improved handling of transactions not found on the blockchain
- Added logic to update transaction status in the database when viewing a transaction
- Better error messages for users

### 4. Added New Scripts

- `check_pending_transactions.py`: A script to check and update the status of pending blockchain transactions
- `run_transaction_checker.sh`: A shell script to run the transaction checker periodically

## How to Use

### Running the Transaction Checker

The transaction checker should be run periodically to update the status of pending transactions. You can run it manually:

```bash
python check_pending_transactions.py
```

Or you can use the provided shell script to run it continuously:

```bash
./run_transaction_checker.sh
```

By default, it will check transactions every 5 minutes. You can specify a different interval (in seconds) as an argument:

```bash
./run_transaction_checker.sh 60  # Check every minute
```

### Transaction Status

Transactions now have three possible statuses:

1. **pending**: The transaction has been submitted to the blockchain but not yet confirmed
2. **confirmed**: The transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain
3. **failed**: The transaction failed or was not found on the blockchain after a certain time

## Future Improvements

1. **Transaction Queue**: Implement a proper queue for blockchain transactions
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retry failed transactions
3. **User Interface**: Add a UI for users to view and manage pending transactions
4. **Notifications**: Notify users when their transactions are confirmed or failed
